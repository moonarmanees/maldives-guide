# Chapter 7: Contractor Procurement and Management
A multi-stage tendering process is required, encompassing pre-qualification, proposal submission, bid evaluation (with risk adjustments), clarification/negotiation, and contract award/finalization.
Key elements of this approach involve engaging main contractors and specialists, adhering to a transparent multi-stage process, utilizing evaluation criteria that consider experience, financial standing, compliance, and ESG factors, and defining contract terms related to milestone payments, variations, and retentions. The procurement process consists of pre-qualification, proposal submission, bid evaluation with risk adjustments, clarification/negotiation, and award/contract finalization.
Key evaluation factors include:
Technical Capability: The bidder must demonstrate expertise in the relevant specialized field.
Financial Soundness: Complete all necessary finance-related due diligence, including obtaining tax clearance, bank guarantees, and credit-worthiness assessments from the Maldives Monetary Authority (MMA).
Past Experience: A proven track record of successfully completing projects of similar nature will be taken into account.
Regulatory Compliance: Bidders must demonstrate adherence to all applicable regulations.
Local Engagement: Proposals should detail the participation and involvement of local resources.
Operational Approach: The proposed methodology and execution plan will be carefully evaluated.
ESG/Safety: Environmental, social, and governance factors, including safety records, will be considered.
