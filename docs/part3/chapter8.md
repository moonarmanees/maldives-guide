# Chapter 8: Construction and Development Works
Figure: Resort Project Gantt Chart by Prime Contractor Category
Resort development work in the Maldives involves several highly specialized construction elements due to its unique geography.
Land Reclamation and Earthworks:
Large-scale resort developments often require significant land reclamation, sometimes on barren lagoons.
Sand is typically sourced from designated borrow areas within the atoll lagoon, often located 2-5 km or up to 10 km from the project site.
Dredging technology primarily involves Trailing Hopper Suction Dredgers (THSD) for large-scale borrow area extraction and Cutter-Suction Dredgers (CSD) for channels and basins.
Reclamation design often specifies areas within platform level and beach slope, with corresponding sand volumes.
The average height of reclamation is typically around +1.8 m MSL (Mean Sea Level), with depth ranges for reclamation areas from -0.9 m to -2.8 m.
Sediment containment measures, such as sand bunds, are crucial during dredging and reclamation to minimize environmental impact.
Marine Works and Coastal Protection:
This is a highly specialized area involving marine and offshore construction, often supported by commercial diving applications.
Contractors in this field frequently operate large fleets of heavy vehicles and specialized equipment for infrastructure and marine development.
Core activities include coastal protection, such as the construction of seawalls, breakwaters, and groynes, which are vital for defense against flooding and erosion.
Shore protection measures are implemented on most of the projects.
Construction material for these structures typically involves imported granite rock and geotextile bags.
Working depths for these structures can range from -0.8 m to -2.0 m, with a maximum elevation of +2.0 m MSL.
Below are some of the sample scenarios on how revetment and groyne are used for shore protections.
Revetment Sample Type 1: Armour Rock (300-1000kg) and smaller Rock (60-300kg) with geotextile, extending from +2.0m MSL down to seabed level varying from -1.3m to -2.3m.
Revetment Sample Type 2: Armour Rock (200-800kg) and Core Rock (10-60kg) with geotextile, extending from +1.8m MSL down to seabed level varying from -1.0m to -1.5m.
Groyne Sample Type 1/2: Uses Armour Rock (200-600kg) with geotextile, reaching +1.2m MSL and down to seabed levels varying from -1.1m to -1.7m.
Other essential marine services encompass underwater pipeline installation, revetment, beach reclamation, lagoon and reef cleaning, geo-tube placement, sheet piling, channel and harbor dredging, pole placement, seagrass removal, demolition, garbage disposal, and quay wall installation.
Overwater Structures: This includes the specialized design, piling, and construction techniques required for overwater villas, restaurants, and other facilities, considering the marine environment.
Sustainable Construction Practices: Integrating sustainable practices, such as the use of renewable energy sources, waste-to-energy solutions, efficient water conservation (e.g., rainwater harvesting, desalination), and waste management strategies, is increasingly important.
Back-of-House Facilities: Construction of essential back-of-house facilities, including staff accommodation, laundries, power plants, and desalination plants, which are critical for resort operations.
FF&E (Furniture, Fixtures, and Equipment) Procurement and Installation: The specialized process of procuring and installing all interior furniture, fixtures, and operational equipment throughout the resort.
IT and Communication Infrastructure: Developing robust IT and communication networks, including smart room technology, to support seamless guest experiences and operational efficiency.
Metal Fabrication and Specialized Structures: This involves workshop services dedicated to metal welding and fabrication. Capabilities typically include producing roof truss works, staircase and balcony railings, pipe works, architectural metalwork, and custom designs for various resort components.
Integrated Logistics and Project Support Services: Beyond construction, comprehensive logistics support services are critical. These can include fabrication, modularization, offsite pre-assembly, procurement, equipment leasing, substantial lifting services, salvage operations, customs facilitation, and responsible management of construction waste and decommissioning.
