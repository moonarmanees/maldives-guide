highly specialized construction elements due to its unique geography.\nLand Reclamation and Earthworks:\nLarge-scale resort developments often require significant land reclamation, sometimes on barren lagoons.\nSand is typically sourced from designated borrow areas within the atoll lagoon, often located 2-5 km or up to 10 km from the project site.\nDredging technology primarily involves Trailing Hopper Suction Dredgers (THSD) for large-scale borrow area extraction and Cutter-Suction Dredgers (CSD) for channels and basins.\nReclamation design often specifies areas within platform level and beach slope, with corresponding sand volumes.\nThe average height of reclamation is typically around +1.8 m MSL (Mean Sea Level), with depth ranges for reclamation areas from -0.9 m to -2.8 m.\nSediment containment measures, such as sand bunds, are crucial during dredging and reclamation to minimize environmental impact.\nMarine Works and Coastal Protection:\nThis is a highly specialized area involving marine and offshore construction, often supported by commercial diving applications.\nContractors in this field frequently operate large fleets of heavy vehicles and specialized equipment for infrastructure and marine development.\nCore activities include coastal protection, such as the construction of seawalls, breakwaters, and groynes, which are vital for defense against flooding and erosion.\nShore protection measures are implemented on most of the projects.\nConstruction material for these structures typically involves imported granite rock and geotextile bags.\nWorking depths for these structures can range from -0.8 m to -2.0 m, with a maximum elevation of +2.0 m MSL.\nBelow are some of the sample scenarios on how revetment and groyne are used for shore protections.\nRevetment Sample Type 1: Armour Rock (300-1000kg) and smaller Rock (60-300kg) with geotextile, extending from +2.0m MSL down to seabed level varying from -1.3m to -2.3m.\nRevetment Sample Type 2: Armour Rock (200-800kg) and Core Rock (10-60kg) with geotextile, extending from +1.8m MSL down to seabed level varying from -1.0m to -1.5m.\nGroyne Sample Type 1/2: Uses Armour Rock (200-600kg) with geotextile, reaching +1.2m MSL and down to seabed levels varying from -1.1m to -1.7m.\nOther essential marine services encompass underwater pipeline installation, revetment, beach reclamation, lagoon and reef cleaning, geo-tube placement, sheet piling, channel and harbor dredging, pole placement, seagrass removal, demolition, garbage disposal, and quay wall installation.\nOverwater Structures: This includes the specialized design, piling, and construction techniques required for overwater villas, restaurants, and other facilities, considering the marine environment.\nSustainable Construction Practices: Integrating sustainable practices, such as the use of renewable energy sources, waste-to-energy solutions, efficient water conservation (e.g., rainwater harvesting, desalination), and waste management strategies, is increasingly important.\nBack-of-House Facilities: Construction of essential back-of-house facilities, including staff accommodation, laundries, power plants, and desalination plants, which are critical for resort operations.\nFF&E (Furniture, Fixtures, and Equipment) Procurement and Installation: The specialized process of procuring and installing all interior furniture, fixtures, and operational equipment throughout the resort.\nIT and Communication Infrastructure: Developing robust IT and communication networks, including smart room technology, to support seamless guest experiences and operational efficiency.\nMetal Fabrication and Specialized Structures: This involves workshop services dedicated to metal welding and fabrication. Capabilities typically include producing roof truss works, staircase and balcony railings, pipe works, architectural metalwork, and custom designs for various resort components.\nIntegrated Logistics and Project Support Services: Beyond construction, comprehensive logistics support services are critical. These can include fabrication, modularization, offsite pre-assembly, procurement, equipment leasing, substantial lifting services, salvage operations, customs facilitation, and responsible management of construction waste and decommissioning."})]})}function m(e={}){const{wrapper:t}={...(0,o.R)(),...e.components};return t?(0,r.jsx)(t,{...e,children:(0,r.jsx)(d,{...e})}):d(e)}}}]);
